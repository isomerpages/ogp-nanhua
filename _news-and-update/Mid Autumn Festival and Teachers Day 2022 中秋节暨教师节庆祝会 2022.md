亲爱的南华小学校友：

  

南华小学将于2022年9月1日（星期四）11:00-12:00 在学校礼堂举办“朗朗中秋月，师恩照我心”2022年中秋节暨教师节庆祝会，欢迎广大校友回校共庆。

  

学校将于庆祝会后关闭，如果您当天想要回母校探望老师，我们建议您先跟您的老师联系，以确保老师知道您回校的具体时间，并在当天由校门E进入学校。

  

敬祝中秋节快乐！

南华小学

  

  

Dear NHPS Alumni,

  

We will be celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival and Teachers' Day on 1st September 2022 (Thursday). We welcome all alumni to celebrate with us at the school auditorium from 11am to 12pm. As the school gates will be closed after the celebration, we highly encourage you to contact your teachers early and inform them that you would like to come on that day. Alumni who wished to come back should enter school via Gate E (near security guard post).

  

Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!
