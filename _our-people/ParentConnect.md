#### **ParentConnect: Join Us in Making a Difference**

As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.” In today’s fast-paced, pressure-packed world, it also takes a village to educate one.


At Nan Hua Primary School, our Parent Support Group (PSG), **ParentConnect**, plays a significant role in this “village.” We work hand in hand with the school to create a nurturing and positive environment where each child can thrive and reach their full potential.

##### **ParentConnect serves as:**
* A platform for parents to complement the school by aligning with the school’s objectives;
* A bridge for parents to engage in their children’s school activities;
* A community for **bonding and networking** between parents and the school; and
* A **platform** for parents to share their perspectives with the school.


##### **Be part of the school's celebration**

ParentConnect is actively involved in the school’s major celebrations. These include:
* **Lunar New Year** celebration where parent volunteers prepare and present Yusheng and 八宝粥 (Eight Treasures Porridge). Parent volunteers help run a variety of stations—from traditional Chinese calligraphy to paper lantern making—to promote cultural appreciation, community spirit, and traditional values such as respect and gratitude.

* **Mid-Autumn Festival** celebration where parent volunteers prepare moon cakes, pomelo and goodie bags as part of the school’s celebration.  Parents join their children for cultural performances, a lantern parade, and enjoy pomelos and traditional mooncakes, deepening their understanding of Chinese heritage and promoting cultural pride and a sense of togetherness among the school community.

* **Teachers’ Day** celebration where ParentConnect presents tokens of appreciation and puts up performances to acknowledge the hard work of our teachers. The performances were special ways to entertain and show our appreciation and gratitude towards the teachers who guide and support our students.
