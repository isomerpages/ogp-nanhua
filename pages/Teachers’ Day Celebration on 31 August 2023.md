Dear former students of NHPS,

As our school is a designated polling centre on 1 Sept Friday and the school will need to be closed for the set up on 31 August, we regret to inform you that we will not be allowing former students to visit on 31 August during our Teachers’ Day Celebrations.

We encourage you to pen your note of thanks to your teachers via the link below.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
