# Overview:

Conducted in a group environment, the Cub Scouts program involves mostly fun games and activities that focus on self-development. The programme is designed to be intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying a childâ€™s basic need to face and overcome challenges.

Through the programme, Scouts will be exposed to the knowledge of basic Scouting skills. As Cub Scouts develop, they will grow in areas like citizenship, leadership and responsibility, physical skills, self-reliance, adventure and fun.

Scouts aim to earn a series of progress badges, which represent their marked achievements in areas such as camp craft, air and water activities, citizenship and improving the environment. The Cub Scouts Section Training Scheme is divided into the following three progress badges and a highest award namely the Bronze Arrow, Silver Arrow, Gold Arrow and the Akela Award.
