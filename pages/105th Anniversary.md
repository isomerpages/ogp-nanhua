<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">We celebrated NHPS 105th anniversary on 25 May 2022. It was a great celebration as representatives from the various stakeholders came together with our staff and students to celebrate our rich heritage and setting of new milestones in our journey as a school. As different generations of the Nan Hua family reunite for the event, it also serves as a reminder to us that we are a school that builds on our past, serve the present, and prepare for the future.</span>
