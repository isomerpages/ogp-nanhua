Co-Curricular Activities plays an integral part in the holistic development of all students. It provides an avenue for our students to discover and develop their areas of interest and strength. The CCA sessions allow students to acquire skills, cultivate healthy habits, inculcate sound values, build character strengths and forge friendships.

The school offers a total of 22 CCAs comprising of 7 Physical Sports, 6 Visual & Performing Arts, 7 Clubs & Societies and 2 Uniformed Groups. There is deliberate effort to provide a variety to meet studentsâ€™ needs and preferences.

Students have the opportunity to exercise their option at the start of the school year in the choice of their participation. Although CCA is not compulsory for primary school students, the participation rate has maintained an average of about 80%.
