The school crest is made up of three eccentric circles, one within the other and with the arc of each circle almost meeting one another at the top. The white English initials of the school name are placed in the innermost circle while the red Chinese characters are placed in the second circle.

The crest has three colours: blue representing decorum, white for integrity and red for love.

The innermost circle represents&nbsp;**righteousness**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**sense of shame**. The second circle represents&nbsp;**loyalty**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**filial piety**. The third circle, which encompasses the first and second circles, symbolises the eight qualities of&nbsp;**courtesy, righteous, integrity, sense of shame, loyalty, filial piety, humanity and love**&nbsp;which we hope to inculcate in our pupils.
