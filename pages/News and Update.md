Dear NHPS Alumni,

  

We will be celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival and Teachers' Day on 1st September 2022 (Thursday). We welcome all alumni to celebrate with us at the school auditorium from 11am to 12pm. As the school gates will be closed after the celebration, we highly encourage you to contact your teachers early and inform them that you would like to come on that day. Alumni who wished to come back should enter school via Gate E (near security guard post).

  

Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

NHPS online art exhibition
----------------------------

Children often express their emotions and thoughts through their artworks. This online art exhibition provides an opportunity for students to learn from one another and to appreciate the work of others. We hope that this Art Exhibition will infuse our pupils with passion and purpose as they cherish the old memories as life is a daily celebration.

The online art exhibition will spread across 4 chapters which would be opened up in different phases. Chapter 1 is ready for viewing and we will slowly open up the rest of the chapters.

NHPS 105th Anniversary
----------------------------

We celebrated NHPS 105th anniversary on 25 May 2022. It was a great celebration as representatives from the various stakeholders came together with our staff and students to celebrate our rich heritage and setting of new milestones in our journey as a school. As different generations of the Nan Hua family reunite for the event, it also serves as a reminder to us that we are a school that builds on our past, serve the present, and prepare for the future. 

Today, 14 June 2022, is the day Nan Hua Primary School turns 105! We have put together the highlights of the celebration we had on 25 May 2022.
