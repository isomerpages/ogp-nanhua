# Overview:

International Chess is one of the CCAs offered under Clubs and Societies in Nan Hua Primary School. The nature of the game gives its members the opportunity to learn and apply the basic rules, moves and strategies of International Chess, and to develop analytical and thinking skills to solve problems. The skills learnt can also be applied in the daily lives of the students.

The training sessions not only focus on fundamental skills and game play, but they also emphasise on values such as perseverance, teamwork, respect and discipline. We firmly believe that participating in International Chess will help to impart the necessary values required to shape one’s character.

## Target Groups:

Offered to P3 to P6 students.

## Objectives:

1. To teach students the basic skills to execute the moves in International Chess (such as checkmate, defend, attack, and plan)
2. To provide opportunities for students to apply the rules and strategic moves in playing the game in various settings
3. To develop student’s self-confidence and to demonstrate good teamwork as well as values of integrity and discipline through playing chess
