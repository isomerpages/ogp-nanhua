# Overview:
Conceptualised in the year 2020, anchored in the Chinese Language, Broadcasting Club aims to develop and strengthen students’ language literacy and critical thinking skills, enabling them to become competent, confident and reflective communicators. Our program also introduces students to a variety of content, covering areas such as Broadcasting, Hosting and Cross-Talk, delivered both by our teachers and expert trainers.

Throughout the year, students will be given opportunities during morning assemblies, respective recesses and official school events and competitions to stretch their potential and practise what they have learnt through the CCA. Whether it is discussing important issues, sharing the music they love or showcasing performances, ‘Voices of Nan Hua’ enables our students a voice within the school.
