# Overview:

The Guzheng Ensemble CCA aims to cultivate students’ interest and passion for the Chinese culture and values through the learning of a traditional Chinese instrument. The instructors employ a variety of teaching strategies to cultivate students’ interest in learning the instrument and to improve their techniques and skills. A conducive learning environment is provided for our students to gain an enriching learning experience.
