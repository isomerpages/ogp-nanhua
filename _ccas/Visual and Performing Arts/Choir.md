# Overview:

Established in 1990, the Nan Hua Primary School Choir has performed well and achieved consistent good results. Being the champion for ‘Sing, Singapore!’ in 1990, the choir has a fine record of several Silver Awards, Gold Awards and Gold with Honors at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging. The choir has also received the Distinction award at every SYF since 2014.

Our mission is to develop the voices of young singers and instill in them the love for singing in a choral setting. Many performance opportunities are provided to enhance their choir experience. Through the years, the choir has been performing on a regular basis at school events, community functions and national public performances.
The choir owes its success to a team of dedicated members, committed teachers, instructors and pianists.

The choir members have always been eager and determined to improve their singing abilities and with their commitment and passion in music, the school is confident that they will soar to greater heights.
