# Overview:

Drama is an exploration and expression of the human condition as people convey personal, social and cultural meanings through it. It is also a social art form that engages the physical, social, cognitive, affective and aesthetic domains in the meaning-making process as participants collectively engage in stories about human beings.

The value of drama education is in developing students’ deep understanding that meaning is socially constructed through their acquisition of disciplinary thinking and practices. Students draw on their personal experiences, observations, interpretation and analysis of stories around them to conceptualise, rehearse and reflect on their use of body, voice and other resources, and present devised or scripted dramatic material for an intended audience.

## Target Groups:

Offered to P3 to P6 students

## Objectives:

1. To teach students to understand the structures and modes of drama and how to create links between play, thought and life
2. To develop students’ ability to enter physically, emotionally and intellectually into the drama world in order to promote questing, empowering and empathetic skills
3. To form the criteria with which to evaluate the drama texts, written or performed, to which students are continually exposed
4. To develop in students the social skills necessary to engage openly, honestly and playfully with others
