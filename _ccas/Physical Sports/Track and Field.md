# Overview:

The sport of Track & Field consists of many different events and the National School Games hosts a maximum of 9 events per level. Each event is very different in technicalities and hence respective training is very much specialised.

Through our CCA, we aim to provide our members with a platform that allows them to strive for excellence and pursue their full potential. One key anchor of the platform is the instilling of right values in the student athletes, such as resilience and self-discipline, which helps lay the foundation for the future.

We hope to support our student athletes’ growth through the collaboration of different stakeholders. Through the process, we hope to create a sense of team and school spirit in our student athletes.
