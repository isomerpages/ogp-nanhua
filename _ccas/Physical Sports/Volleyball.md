# Overview:

Volleyball is one of the few team sports offered as a CCA in Nan Hua Primary School. The nature of the sport gives its members the opportunity to learn and apply the basic rules and techniques of volleyball in the game, and to develop many values and life skills such as self-esteem, strong relationships, teamwork, perseverance and resilience. The training sessions not only focus on fundamental skills, fitness conditioning and game play, it also emphasises discipline and team building. We firmly believe that participating in a team sport like Volleyball will help to impart the necessary values required to shape oneâ€™s character.
