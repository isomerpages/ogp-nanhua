# Overview:

The Chinese Dance CCA in Nan Hua has a long history. Since its establishment, numerous awards have been added to its track record, an affirmation of the team’s ability in scaling new heights. Our achievements include being awarded the overall champion in the national category at ‘Sing! Singapore’ in 1990 to a string of distinction awards at SYF.

The Chinese Dance CCA is led by a team of dedicated teachers and experienced coaches. Our mission is to instil in students a love for dance, while developing self-confidence, perseverance, teamwork and inculcate respect for the performing arts.

The Chinese traditional dance is used as a foundation to impart the importance of poise, alignment and technique to members of the CCA. Students are also given opportunities to experience various dance genres and styles ranging from cultural and modern e.g. K-Pop and Hip Hop which are very popular among the youths.
