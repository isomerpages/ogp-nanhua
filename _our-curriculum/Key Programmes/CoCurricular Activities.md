Co-Curricular Activities plays an integral part in the holistic development of all students. It provides an avenue for our students to discover and develop their areas of interest and strength. The CCA sessions allow students to acquire skills, cultivate healthy habits, inculcate sound values, build character strengths and forge friendships.

The school offers a total of 20 CCAs comprising of 6 Physical Sports, 6 Visual & Performing Arts, 6 Clubs & Societies and 2 Uniformed Groups. There is deliberate effort to provide a variety to meet students’ needs and preferences.

Students have the opportunity to exercise their option at the start of the school year in the choice of their participation. Although CCA is not compulsory for primary school students, the participation rate has maintained an average of about 80%.

For Primary 3 students, they will undergo a Flourish Program during their first year in the CCA. This allows them to explore and discover their interests and talents in CCAs from 4 Categories: Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups, Visual and Performing Arts, and Club & Societies before formally committing to a CCA in Primary 4.

In this Flourish Program, Primary 3 students will get to experience a different CCA each term from three of the categories. The table below is an illustration of a Primary 3 student’s journey in the Flourish Program.

**An example of a Primary 3 students’ experience in the flourish program**


| Term | Term 1 | Term 2 | Term 3 | Term 4 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| CCA     | Volleyball     | Wei Qi     | Dance | Reflection & CCA Options |
| CCA Category | Sports & Games | Club and Societies | Visual and Performing Arts | |

Following their experiences in Primary 3, the students will then decide and commit to a CCA in Primary 4. In order to benefit from their involvement in the CCA, the school strongly encourages students to invest sufficient time in developing interests and talents and remain in their CCAs from Primary 4-6. As such, Primary 4 – 6 Students will only allowed to change their CCAs with valid reasons.
