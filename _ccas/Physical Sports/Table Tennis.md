# Overview:

Table Tennis is a good activity to introduce sports to young children. Like all sports, it teaches students that discipline and hard work are needed to excel in any endeavor. We hope that every student who chooses this sport will have the opportunity to not only develop the technical skills but also acquire positive social, emotional skills related to taking up a sport.

## Target Groups:

Offered to P3 to P6 students

## Objectives:

1. To teach students the skills to execute basic and intermediate/ advance table tennis strokes for game play
2. To develop students’ confidence in the execution and application of the skills and/or strategies learnt
3. To heighten students’ social awareness and consideration for fellow members, teammates and opponents
4. To provide a platform for students to develop and display fair play and good sportsmanship at all times
5. To inculcate values of hard work and discipline in a sport
