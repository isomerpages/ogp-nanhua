<h4><strong>ParentConnect: Join Us in Making a Difference</strong></h4>
<p>As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.” In today’s
fast-paced, pressure-packed world, it also takes a village to educate one.</p>
<p>At Nan Hua Primary School, our Parent Support Group (PSG), <strong>ParentConnect</strong>,
plays a significant role in this “village.” We work hand in hand with the
school to create a nurturing and positive environment where each child
can thrive and reach their full potential.</p>
<h4><strong>ParentConnect serves as:</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A platform for parents to <strong>complement the school</strong> by aligning
with the school’s objectives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bridge for <strong>parents to engage</strong> in their children’s school
activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A community for <strong>bonding and networking</strong> between parents
and the school; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>platform</strong> for parents to share their perspectives with
the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Be part of the school's celebration</strong></h4>
<p>ParentConnect is actively involved in the school’s major celebrations.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lunar New Year</strong> celebration where parent volunteers prepare
and present Yusheng and 八宝粥 (Eight Treasures Porridge). Parent volunteers
help run a variety of stations—from traditional Chinese calligraphy to
paper lantern making—to promote cultural appreciation, community spirit,
and traditional values such as respect and gratitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mid-Autumn Festival</strong> celebration where parent volunteers
prepare moon cakes, pomelo and goodie bags as part of the school’s celebration.
Parents join their children for cultural performances, a lantern parade,
and enjoy pomelos and traditional mooncakes, deepening their understanding
of Chinese heritage and promoting cultural pride and a sense of togetherness
among the school community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teachers’ Day</strong> celebration where ParentConnect presents
tokens of appreciation and puts up performances to acknowledge the hard
work of our teachers. The performances were special ways to entertain and
show our appreciation and gratitude towards the teachers who guide and
support our students.</p>

<h4><strong>Be part of your child’s learning journey</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The school and ParentConnect organise various exciting activities for
students to learn and explore in fun and engaging ways while allowing parents
to be involved in their children’s learning journey. From Mother’s Day
and Teachers' Day to Children's Day, World Book Day, Racial Harmony Day,
International Friendship Day, and our Sports Carnival, these events enable
students to have fun while learning and celebrating important milestones.
Parent volunteers play a key role in making these events enjoyable and
meaningful, helping students develop important values and teamwork skills.
As parents, we create memorable experiences as we get involved and make
a difference in our child’s learning experience!</p>
<p></p>
<p>“<strong><em>Students are more engaged with school and enjoy it better when their parents take an interest in their school life by getting involved in activities, such as volunteering, parent-teacher meetings or school events</em></strong>”,
The Straits Times reported in a study conducted by NIE involving some 7,500
students from 37 schools in 2022.</p>

<h4><strong>Be part of the parents’ network, creating memorable experiences together</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>ParentConnect fosters bonding and networking among parents through various
activities, such as dialogues, the Yuanxiao (元宵) gathering, Appreciation
Day, and social events like bowling, movie screenings, and outdoor outings.
These gatherings strengthen connections within the school community, bringing
parents together in a supportive environment. These events also serve to
acknowledge and appreciate our regular volunteers for their dedicated efforts
in supporting the school and our children.</p>
