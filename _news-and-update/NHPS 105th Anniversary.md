We celebrated NHPS 105th anniversary on 25 May 2022. It was a great celebration as representatives from the various stakeholders came together with our staff and students to celebrate our rich heritage and setting of new milestones in our journey as a school. As different generations of the Nan Hua family reunite for the event, it also serves as a reminder to us that we are a school that builds on our past, serve the present, and prepare for the future. 

Today, 14 June 2022, is the day Nan Hua Primary School turns 105! We have put together the highlights of the celebration we had on 25 May 2022.
