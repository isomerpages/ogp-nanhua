# Overview:
Percussion band CCA aims to cultivate students’ interest in percussion music through the hands-on learning experiences with various drums and other percussion instruments. Students will be exposed to the typical drumline setup of percussion instruments where they will have opportunities to learn and master the different techniques. In this CCA, we encourage students with little or no experience in percussion music to join.

The instructor uses various methods to teach the students the skills they require, of which will be accessible to both students at the beginner and intermediate levels. Through shared learning experiences with their peers, students will also be able to develop important values such as teamwork, where they get to work collaboratively, encourage one another and enjoy music together.

The teachers, together with the instructor, work to instil a sense of discipline in the students. This allows them to work towards mastery of the instrument, while developing their passion for percussion music.
